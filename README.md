# simpal.github.io
an artificial e-commerce website 
for now--> this is a note for the devs

1. we need to adjust the logo size on all the indexes throught the pages.
2. we have to check if the anchors are all correct.
3. in the main index, 1. need to change the nav bar color to match the color theme.
                      2. need to make a scroll bar for the images on the main page.
                      3. add a few contents below the images section. there will be a few bugs to deal with the positioning.
                      4. need to add a footer section with info and contacts.
                      5. we also need to make the nav bar static so that the user can always see it and go back to top.
4. start filling content for the separate pages.
